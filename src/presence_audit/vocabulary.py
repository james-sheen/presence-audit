"""What a vertical must supply, and the registry it supplies it through.

The neutral machinery classifies declared points and reports how many fell into
each class. Both of those need a vocabulary, and the vocabulary is the domain:
one bridge's kinds are sensors and not-sensors, another's are assets and
fixtures. So it is supplied, not imported.

**The count keys are part of this, and that is not obvious.** The report a
consumer reads carries per-kind counts under key names taken from the domain. If
the vertical supplied only the classifier, the neutral code would still have to
name the keys, and naming them is the leak. So a vocabulary supplies the names of
its own kinds AND the names they are reported under.

**An empty registry is an error, never a default.** A registry that is quiet when
nothing registered produces a run that classifies nothing and reports cleanly,
which is worse than a crash: everything imports, nothing works, and the first
sign is a wrong answer in somebody's report.
