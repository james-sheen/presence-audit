"""Compare two walks of the same machine: what did the firmware change?

`compare` in this package answers *does the machine match its declaration*. This
answers a different question, and the difference is the whole reason the module
exists: **which sensors did this firmware update remove, rename, or re-threshold?**

Those two are not the same check, and running the first one twice does not
produce the second. A firmware that renames `FAN0` to `Fan 0` still matches the
declaration under the normalised matcher, so a config diff reports nothing while
every dashboard, alert rule and trend query keyed on the old string goes quiet. A
firmware that widens a threshold both walks agree on is invisible for the same
reason. The comparison has to be walk against walk, with the declaration out of it.

**Identity is layered, and the layering is what makes a rename derivable.** A
sensor is paired to its counterpart by NAME first -- the string every downstream
consumer keys on -- and whatever is left is paired by Redfish URI *with the units
and resource type agreeing*, because some firmware numbers sensors positionally
and inserting one shifts every URI after it. A pair that matched that way with two
different names is a rename, stated as one. A sensor whose name and URI both
changed is reported as one removal and one addition, and the report says so rather
than guessing which addition replaced which removal: there is no evidence in two
walks that would settle it, and a wrong guess reads exactly like a right one.

**An incomplete walk withholds absence, on both sides.** The rule `compare` applies
to one walk applies here twice over. A partial *after* walk renders as a firmware
that deleted a chassis full of sensors, which is the most alarming possible way to
report a network timeout.

**An aggregation prefix is DECLARED, never inferred.** A BMC that aggregates a
satellite controller prefixes the resources it republishes, and a prefix that
changes across a firmware or topology change moves every name behind it at once --
which reads here as a mass removal plus a mass addition. `--aggregation-prefix
OLD=NEW` is how an operator states that the two are the same subtree, and the
pairing it produces is annotated so a reader can see the claim it rests on. Nothing
auto-pairs: a prefix map is a claim about topology, and topology claims are
declared. What this module does on its own is *notice* the shape -- a set of names
sharing one leading string vanishing while an identically-shaped set sharing
another appears -- and say so, naming the two prefixes it saw. Surfaced, not
assumed.
