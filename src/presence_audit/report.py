"""Render a diff two ways: for a machine, and for the person who owns the thing.

Acceptance criterion 4 of Stage 1 is that a before/after run produces a diff its
owner can read without explanation. That rules out a wall of JSON, and it rules
out a summary that hides which point is affected.

THE WORDS ARE THE DOMAIN'S, NOT THIS MODULE'S. Every noun a reader sees comes
from `vocabulary.noun()`, because a module that cannot name the domain cannot
name the things in it either. This file used to spell one domain's words into
every sentence it printed, so a factory line was told about its coverage, and
about its equipment, in nouns belonging to a different industry. A neutral core
that picks a vertical's vocabulary is not neutral -- it just has a favourite.

The human view leads with the counts, because the first question is always how
much of it is fine, and then lists findings grouped by kind with the most
actionable first. The machine view is stable, sorted, and carries the
attribution -- which config declared it, which URI reported it -- because a
finding without a source is a finding nobody can act on.
