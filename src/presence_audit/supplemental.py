"""Declarations the machine does not make about itself, written down by an operator.

Two axioms need a fact `entity-manager` has no way to state, and neither can be
derived from the configuration however carefully it is read:

**Redundancy.** CONSISTENCY can check that two readings which should agree do.
Nothing in `entity-manager` says two sensors measure the same thing. The tempting
derivation is the multi-channel part -- a TMP421 declares `Name` and `Name1`, so pair
them -- and it is wrong on the physics: those two channels are the chip's own die and
an external diode, which differ by tens of degrees on a working board. The other
tempting derivation is identical declared thresholds, and the pinned corpus refutes it
outright: `SLED1_THERM_LOCAL` through `SLED6_THERM_LOCAL` carry the same four numbers
and sit on six different parts.

So redundancy is a claim about the hardware, and this project's rule for the shape of
that claim already exists in the engine's own modelling guide: **a floor is a
specification, not a guess.** A pairing is the same kind of sentence. Auto-pairing
would have produced a tool that reports disagreement between two things that were
never the same measurement, which is worse than not checking -- it is a false positive
that looks like the feature working.

**Counters.** MONOTONICITY judges values that only ever climb. Power-on hours and
error counters mostly live outside `entity-manager` altogether, so which readings are
cumulative is also operator knowledge.

**Flows.** CONSERVATION checks that what goes into a device comes out of it, minus a
tolerated loss. `entity-manager` does declare the readings -- the pinned Ampere
Mt.Jade configuration exposes `PSU0_PINPUT` and `PSU0_POUTPUT` -- but nothing in the
file says the second is the first minus conversion loss, and nothing says what loss is
acceptable. **The loss margin is an efficiency figure off a datasheet**, which is the
same kind of number as a threshold floor and gets the same treatment: declared, with
its basis, or absent.

Those two readings also carry **no thresholds at all**, so the generator's ordinary
rule excludes them -- a sensor with nothing to bound against is a question nobody
asked. Naming one in a flow is what asks the question, so a flow participant is
modelled whether or not it has bounds.

## The file

    {
      "format": "presence-audit/supplemental/1",
      "provenance": "who established this and how",
      "redundant_groups": [
        {"sensors": ["A", "B"], "tolerance": 0.05,
         "basis": "why these are the same measurement"}
      ],
      "counters": [
        {"sensor": "PWR_ON_HOURS", "direction": "increasing", "allow_reset": true,
         "basis": "why this only climbs"}
      ]
    }

**`basis` is required and is not decoration.** It is the difference between a
specification and a guess, and it is the field a reviewer reads first. A group without
one is refused rather than accepted with a warning, because a warning on a path that
still works is a warning nobody reads.

Sensors are named as the declaration names them -- `display_name`, so a pmbus rail is
`NAME:LABEL`. A name this file mentions and the declaration does not is refused too:
the likeliest cause is a typo, and a typo silently drops the pairing it was written to
create, leaving a file that looks like the check is running.
