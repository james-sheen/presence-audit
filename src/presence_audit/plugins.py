"""How a vertical's registration reaches a process that did not import it.

`register()` is a Python call. A consumer running the command line never makes
one, so without this the door exists and the entrance most people use does not
reach it.

Three ways in, all resolved before anything is read:

- an entry point in the group `presence_audit.plugins`. This package declares
  NONE: it has no domain of its own, which is the point of it;
- `PRESENCE_AUDIT_PLUGINS`, an `os.pathsep`-separated list of specs -- and on
  POSIX that separator is `:`, the same character that introduces a callable, so
  the list is reassembled from the right. `environment_specs` has the rule and
  the one pair it cannot tell apart;
- `--plugin SPEC`, repeatable.

A spec is `module.path`, `module.path:callable`, or `path/to/file.py[:callable]`.
The callable defaults to `register`.

**A plugin that fails is a failure, not a skip.** A run that needed the kinds a
broken vertical would have registered must be refused by name, here, rather than
raising somewhere downstream about a vocabulary that was never supplied.

    Resolved by reassembling FROM THE RIGHT: a fragment that is a bare callable
    name belongs to the fragment before it. `a:register:b:register` is two
    specs, `a:b` is two specs, `a:register` is one.

    WHAT THIS CANNOT EXPRESS, on a platform where `os.pathsep` is `:`. Two
    modules whose names carry no dot -- `alpha:beta` -- read as `beta` in
    `alpha`, because nothing distinguishes that from a callable. The ambiguity
    is in the grammar rather than in this function: one character cannot both
    separate specs and introduce a callable. Name such a pair with `--plugin`
    twice instead. Measured over the shapes this project actually uses, it is
