"""A per-run record of what was checked, what was declined, and on what evidence.

The engine answers `check()` with findings and declines. That is enough for an exit
code and not enough for an audit, because it drops the numbers: a finding says
*reading exceeds critical threshold* and never says the reading was 51.2 against a
declared 50.0. `attest()` returns those, and this assembles them into an artifact a
run can be judged from afterwards.

**Three things it records, and the second and third are the point.**

*What was checked* is the easy half. *What was declined* is the half a compliance
reader actually needs: an axiom that could not be evaluated is not an axiom that
passed, and an artifact listing only findings reads as a clean bill of health for
every question nobody managed to ask. *What this record does not establish* is the
third, and it is carried verbatim from the engine rather than written here.

## The engine's own boundary, quoted rather than paraphrased

Every evidence entry `attest()` returns carries a `boundary` string. On 0.1.7 it
reads *engine-side evidence only; production attestation records are v0.2*. That is
the engine declining to be called an attestation service, and it belongs in the
artifact for the same reason a decline does. Paraphrasing it would make this file
the author of a disclaimer the engine wrote.

## Sequencing, which is a real contract and not an implementation detail

`attest()` requires `check()` to have run on the same session. Called first it
returns an envelope with `source: unavailable` and the reason *nothing checked yet:
call check first* -- an honest refusal, and one that would be easy to mistake for
*this run found nothing to attest*. So this module never calls `attest` speculatively:
it takes the problem types out of an envelope `check()` already produced.
