"""Feed a walk into the engine, and turn its envelope into an exit code.

The generator built the model. This supplies the readings and decides what the answer
means for CI.

**Stage 1 owns presence; only present-and-reading sensors are fed.** That is the
layering rule, and it is a blast-radius choice rather than a workaround: absence is a
question Stage 1 already answers precisely, with a three-valued verdict the engine has
no equivalent for. Feeding an absent sensor would ask the engine to re-derive something
weaker. The engine's own `missing_property` decline stays valuable as the belt to that
brace — if it ever fires, Stage 1 said a sensor was reading and its value did not reach
the model, which is a mapping bug and fails the gate.

**A single walk is one sample, and stuck-at needs about ten.** So liveness warms up:
until enough in-window observations exist, STABILITY declines `insufficient_samples`
and that decline is *reported*, not suppressed. A tool that hid it would look like it
was checking liveness from the first walk, which is the vacuous pass this project keeps
finding in other people's systems.

**Three decline classes, because the vocabulary is not ours.** A decline that asserts
the core case fails the gate; a decline about data sufficiency reports and passes; and
a reason this build does not recognise is reported prominently and does not silently
join either bucket. The engine's reason vocabulary is not exported as a constant, so
this classification is built from reasons actually observed — which makes an unknown
reason a certainty over time, not a hypothetical.

Nothing here imports `arbiter_engine` at module scope. Stage 1 must keep running on a
bench with nothing provisioned.

# new fact. Measured against both engines on one model -- a declared power flow
# on a rail reading zero watts in: the pinned build declines `not_applicable`,
# the next one declines `undefined_for_values`, findings empty in both. The
# engine split a reason that was three answers under one name; this is the arm
# that means *the quantity has no value on these values*, which is what the
# paragraph above already describes.
#
# Classified ahead of the release on purpose. An unknown member lands in
# `unclassified_declines`, which is the correct behaviour and would have failed
# `--strict` on the day the pin moved, for a case this build has understood
# since 0.1.8. Reported from outside, measured here before believing it.

# A check that was declared and never made answerable: the model states the
# axiom and supplies no number for it to compare against.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A MODEL DEFECT, EVEN THOUGH THIS PACKAGE WRITES THE MODEL.
# The generator already withholds BOUNDEDNESS from a sensor whose BMC declares no
# thresholds, precisely so the engine is never asked a question nobody set. It
# cannot do the same for MONOTONICITY: declaring the axiom gets the reversal arm
# AND the rate arm, and there is no way to declare one without the other. So a
# counter arrives with a rate arm nobody bounded, and this package cannot bound
# it -- power-on hours climb at one per 3600 s and a correctable-ECC count has no
# published rate at all. That number is an operator-knowledge fact, which is the
# wall the supplemental declarations channel exists for and where this belongs
# in the long run.
#
# WHY NOT FOLDED INTO THE SET ABOVE. `_NOT_APPLICABLE_REASONS` means *the
# question is meaningless against the values that arrived*. This one means
# *nobody supplied the number*. Same bucket by decision, different fact -- and
# lumping them would make that set's own comment false, which is the exact drift
# this file keeps catching in itself.
#
# CLASSIFIED AHEAD OF THE RELEASE, the same way `undefined_for_values` was, and
# for a measured reason rather than a cautious one. An unreleased engine build
# makes MONOTONICITY's rate arm decline `no_threshold` when no rate is declared;
# before this line, that reason was in none of the five sets here, so it fell to
# `unclassified_declines` and `--strict` went from 0 to 1 on every healthy BMC
# carrying a counter. Measured by calling `evaluate` with that envelope, not
# inferred from reading the engine.
#
# `--strict` STILL FAILS on it, and should: a check that was never made
# answerable is not established, and strict is the mode that says so.
