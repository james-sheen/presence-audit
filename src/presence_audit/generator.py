"""Turn a declaration into an `arbiter-engine` domain model, and say what it left out.

Stage 2 asks the engine a question Stage 1 cannot: *is this point still alive?* The
engine answers against a domain model, and nobody is going to hand-write one for a
declaration carrying thousands of points. This generates it.

**The output is a pair, and the second half is not optional.** A model, and a manifest
recording every declaration that did not become part of it and why. A generator that
silently drops what it cannot express produces a model that looks complete and audits
less than the reader believes — which is the same defect as a coverage tool that counts
things that were never going to read, one layer along.

Four things this has to get right, each because the obvious version is wrong:

**One entity type per point.** Thresholds live on entity *types* in the engine, and
every declared point has its own values. The per-entity override path exists and is not
wired into BOUNDEDNESS, so it cannot be used — measured, and **re-measured against
0.1.7**, which is
where an expansion plan expected this to have changed. It has not: the engine's own
`axiom_thresholds` module lists BOUNDEDNESS under `OVERRIDE_DECLARED_BUT_UNREACHABLE`
and states that an override never touches a *declared* threshold at all. A type per
point costs about 3 seconds at a thousand of them, so the explosion is affordable; it has
to be recorded, because the type name is sanitised and every finding will name the
sanitised form.

**Lower bounds are declared, not negated.** They used to be: BOUNDEDNESS was
upper-bound-only, so a lower bound became a second indicator carrying the *negated*
reading against negated thresholds, and the report layer un-inverted the text on the way
out. Engine 0.1.7 takes `lower_warning:` and `lower_critical:` directly and says
*is below critical threshold* itself, so the whole mechanism — the mirrored indicator,
the mirrored observations, the translation — is deleted rather than kept working. One
indicator per point now carries both bound pairs, and a point declaring both gets a
band.

> **If you got here by grepping for `neg`, this is the answer: it is gone.** Every
> match in this file is prose *about* the removal, and a word-level grep counts the
> explanation as if it were the thing.
>
> The symbol the mechanism actually used was **`READING_LOW`**. Grep that instead
> and you get exactly one hit: this sentence. That is deliberate — nought hits
> would be ambiguous between *retired* and *you mistyped it* — and it is enforced,
> because the first draft of this paragraph claimed the symbol was absent from the
> package while being the reason it was not. `test_the_retired_symbol_survives_only_here`
> asserts that no CODE uses it, docstrings excluded, which is the claim that
> actually matters.

**Levels beyond warning and critical are recorded, not folded.** A declaration format
may carry more severity levels than the engine has slots for. Folding the outermost one
into `critical` would move the alarm point to a different number and call it the same
thing. They go in the manifest as unmapped.

**Only auditable points are generated.** Types the vertical does not audit, and
templated names, are excluded before generation rather than filtered afterwards. A
`$bus`-style name fed to the engine becomes an entity type nothing can ever match, and
the engine has no way to tell you that.
