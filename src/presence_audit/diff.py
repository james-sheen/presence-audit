"""Compare what is declared against what is reported. This is the product.

Every other module exists to feed this one. The comparison answers a question no
monitoring stack asks, because none of them read the declaration: **which sensors
should be here and are not?**

Three design commitments, each of which costs code and each of which exists
because the cheap version produces a confidently wrong report:

**Matching is layered and always attributed.** A declared name matches a live one
exactly, or after normalisation, or -- for the roughly one name in eight that
carries a runtime template like `$bus` -- through a pattern derived from that
template. Every match records *how* it was made, so a fuzzy match is visible in
the output rather than indistinguishable from an exact one. A tool that silently
fuzzy-matches will eventually pair two unrelated sensors and report a clean
board.

**An incomplete walk is not an empty machine.** If any fetch failed, absence
findings are withheld entirely rather than reported against a partial picture.
A transport failure that renders as `47 sensors missing` is worse than no report,
because someone will act on it.

**Presence is three-valued, not two.** Present and reading, present but disabled
or unreadable, and entirely absent are three different hardware conditions with
three different responses. Collapsing the middle one into either neighbour loses
the case this tool was built for -- the disabled sensor that no UI displays.
