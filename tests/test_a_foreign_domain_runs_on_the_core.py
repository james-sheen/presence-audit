"""A whole domain, driving this package end to end.

In `bmc-sensor-audit` this file asserted that the core could serve a domain it
was not written for. Here that framing is gone, because this package was written
for no domain at all -- so what it now asserts is simply that the thing works:
one vocabulary, one capture shape, one declaration shape, and a three-valued
answer that discriminates.

The original framing is kept in the paragraph below because it is still the
reason the file exists.

A domain this package was not written for, running on its neutral core.

No BMC anything: a factory-line vocabulary, factory-line data in its own shape
-- time-ordered samples of many nodes, and an asset register -- adapted onto the
protocols, driven through the same `compare()` the presence audit is written in.

This is the measurement the neutral-core work exists to produce. If it stops
passing, the core has stopped being shared and is only this domain's code with
an indirection.

The stand-ins below implement the published protocols and NOTHING ELSE -- no
`__iter__`, no `__len__`, no convenience the concrete BMC types happen to have.
That is the point of them. A fixture that adds a member to get past a call site
proves the core can serve a domain that already knows what the document does not
say, which is not the claim.
