"""The neutral protocols, and the foreign shape that proves they are neutral.

A protocol derived from one implementation is that implementation's types under
a neutral name. It passes every test its own author would write, and the first
foreign shape breaks it. So this file adapts a shape this package did not come
from -- time-ordered samples of many nodes, and an asset register -- built here
out of plain dictionaries and importing nothing.

THE OTHER HALF LIVES IN `test_a_shipped_bridge_satisfies_the_protocols.py`,
because it adapts a REAL bridge and therefore has to import one. Splitting them
is the whole point: this file must run in a clone with nothing else installed,
and it used to be uncollectable there -- one import of a package this
distribution does not depend on, at module scope, and the entire file was gone,
including the check that the core imports no vertical.

Both adapters are EXERCISED, not merely defined. `isinstance` against a
`Protocol` proves the names exist; calling every member through an adapter proves
the protocol carries something. Each test asserts its adapter produced points, so
an adapter that quietly yields nothing cannot pass.

REWRITTEN 2026-09-07 at the measured surface. The protocols carried nine members
and the consuming modules reach twenty-three; the nine came from a scan that
filtered attribute reads by variable name. The foreign adapter below is now the
load-bearing part of this file: if a domain with seventeen of the concepts can
implement all twenty-three -- six of them by answering ABSENT -- then the
protocol is implementable by something other than its author, which is the only
property that makes it a protocol.
